Additional Notes:

- Ensure all GND connections are common to avoid potential differences that could affect sensor readings.
- The ESP32 should be powered via a stable power source, either through the USB or a dedicated 5V regulated power supply connected to the VIN pin.
- Use appropriate wire gauges for connections, especially for the relay and water pump to handle the current.
- Double-check all connections before powering up the system to prevent any shorts or misconfigurations.
